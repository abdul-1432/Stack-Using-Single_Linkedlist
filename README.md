# Queue using Single Linked List in C

This repository contains a C program that implements a queue data structure using a single linked list. The program provides various operations such as adding elements, deleting elements, reversing the list, and displaying the list elements.

## Program Overview

The program consists of the following files:

- `queue.h`: This header file contains the structure definition and function prototypes for the queue implementation.

- `queue.c`: This source file contains the implementation of the queue operations, including adding elements, deleting elements, reversing the list, and displaying the list elements.

- `main.c`: This source file contains the main function where you can test and execute the queue operations.

## Usage

To use the queue program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abdul-1432/Stack-Using-Single_Linkedlist/new/DS_Single_Linkedlist
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

   ```
   cd queue-using-single-linked-list
   ```

3. Open the `main.c` file and modify it according to your needs. You can customize the program by adding or removing elements, calling different operations, etc.

4. Compile the program using a C compiler:

   ```
   gcc main.c queue.c -o queue
   ```

5. Run the program:

   ```
   ./queue
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various queue operations, such as adding elements, deleting elements, reversing the list, and displaying the list elements.
